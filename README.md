# LandminePlacerFix üõ†Ô∏è
A Lethal Company mod that adds the **Landmine Placer**, a new item for placing landmines and ending long-lasting friendships.

## Important ‚ö†Ô∏è
This project is a fork of [LandminePlacer by alexandre-v1](https://github.com/alexandre-v1/LandminePlacer), which is no longer
actively developed and is incompatible with newer versions of [LethalLib by Evaisa](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Evaisa/LethalLib/). LandminePlacerFix addresses these issues, as well as any 
future ones that might prevent the mod from working as intended.

Please take into account that no **new** features will be added.
